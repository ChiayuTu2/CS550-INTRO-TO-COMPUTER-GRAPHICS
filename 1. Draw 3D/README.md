<h2 align = "center">Instruction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You can use pre-canned 3D objects, such as the ones that GLUT provides, or the OSU functions that we provide, or OBJ files, but in addition to your own, not instead of. You must create your own geometry.</li>
        <li>You can explicitly list your own 3D coordinates, or you can use equations and define the 3D shapes procedurally.</li>
        <li>You must have at least 100 x-y-z coordinates. These can be divided up among multiple of your objects.</li>
        <li>The scene must have 3D thickness, nothing that is completely planar.</li>
        <li>You must use at least 5 different colors.</li>
        <li>The 3D rotation and scaling from the sample program must still be working.</li>
    </ol>

<h2 align = "center">Project Overview</h2>
To achieve the desired outcomes for my project, I began by drafting preliminary designs on coordinate paper. Utilizing glVertex3f(), I was able to translate these concepts into 3D models. To streamline the creation of recurring patterns, I encapsulated one pattern in a function and replicated it across different positions through scaling and translation. The model now includes a fully realized trunk, leaves, ground, and pond. Additionally, I ventured into learning about trigonometric functions and glVertex3f() to craft a spherical sun. While the sun's body is complete, I am still working on simulating the surrounding luminosity.
